# Web Applications

This directory houses the web frontends that ship with the E-CO project.

- `ethos/` – contains the Ethos experience, including the dedicated backend and frontend packages documented inside `ethos/`.
- `pod-world/` – contains the Pod World Next.js shell. See `pod-world/README.md` for development and testing instructions.

Each application maintains its own tooling and configuration so they can evolve independently.

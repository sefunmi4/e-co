# Public Assets

Static files that should be served verbatim by Next.js belong here. The build
step copies `shared/environments.json` into this directory so the frontend can
list available Ether environments. Drop additional icons, WASM bundles, or other
assets that need to be reachable via `/` paths into this folder.

# Frontend

This directory houses the client-facing pieces of the E-CO web shell. The Next.js `app` router entrypoints live in `app/` and re-exported wrappers in the workspace root keep the framework happy. Reusable UI building blocks – such as the desktop shell, command palette, and dashboards – sit in `components/` alongside their co-located tests.

Expect to find presentation code, hooks, and other browser-only logic here.
